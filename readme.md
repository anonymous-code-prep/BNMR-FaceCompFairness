# Code implementation for Component-Based Fairness in Face Attribute Classification with Bayesian Network-informed Meta Learning 

### Requirement
To prepare the environment, use `./environment.txt` file and conda.

### Training
The training entry is in `./src/train.sh`. In `train.sh`, replace the data_root argument with the path to folder containing CelebA dataset. 

### Visualizations and Models 
Please find the learned Bayesian Network under `BNMR/save/(test)bnn[1, 6, 7, 14, 24].xml`, accompanied with the visualization for 5 attributes and all attributes DAG.
